1. Sales & Revenue Metrics <br>

Average Order Value (AOV): Total revenue divided by the number of orders. A higher AOV indicates higher spending per customer. <br> <br>
Conversion Rate: Percentage of visitors who complete a purchase. This is a key indicator of how well the website turns visitors into buyers. <br> <br>
Customer Lifetime Value (CLV): The predicted total revenue from a customer over the entire period of their relationship with the store. <br> <br>
Gross Profit Margin: Revenue minus the cost of goods sold (COGS), divided by revenue. It shows how profitable each sale is after accounting for product costs. <br> <br>
Cart Abandonment Rate: Percentage of shoppers who add items to their cart but do not complete the purchase. Reducing this rate can increase revenue. <br>
