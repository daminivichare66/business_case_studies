1. Sales & Revenue Metrics
Total Sales Revenue: The total income generated from eCommerce sales. <br>
Average Order Value (AOV): Total revenue divided by the number of orders. A higher AOV indicates higher spending per customer. <br>
Conversion Rate: Percentage of visitors who complete a purchase. This is a key indicator of how well the website turns visitors into buyers.
Customer Lifetime Value (CLV): The predicted total revenue from a customer over the entire period of their relationship with the store.
Gross Profit Margin: Revenue minus the cost of goods sold (COGS), divided by revenue. It shows how profitable each sale is after accounting for product costs.
Cart Abandonment Rate: Percentage of shoppers who add items to their cart but do not complete the purchase. Reducing this rate can increase revenue.
